Proposal:

Group 5 would like to develop a 3D first person shooter tower defense game for Android. 
The game will consist of a central base which the player is in control of, 
the player may collect resources by defending their base and killing enemies. 
Resources may be spent to upgrade and purchase structures for the central base 
in order to better defend against enemies. Enemy attacks will be available in waves 
which the player may elect to summon, in addition to this enemy attacks will occur
randomly throughout the day whether or not the player is participating. 
The game will utilize OpenGL to render the 3D and artwork/graphics will 
consist of simple yet clean box shaped characters.

Web Application:
We will also feature a website to track user data and events.
